Access Modifiers

In C#, access modifiers are keywords that specify the accessibility or visibility of types and type members (such as fields, methods, properties, and events) within a program. These modifiers control how other parts of the program can interact with the elements they are applied to.

Here are the access modifiers in C#:

1. public: The member is accessible from any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.

2. private: The member is accessible only within the same class or struct.

3. protected: The member is accessible within its class and by derived classes.

4. internal: The member is accessible only within files in the same assembly.

5. protected internal: The member is accessible within the same assembly and by derived classes.

6. private protected: Introduced in C# 7.2, this modifier allows access within the same assembly by derived classes, but only if they're in the same assembly as well.

Access modifiers are important for encapsulation and controlling the visibility of your code's members, which helps in writing maintainable and secure applications
