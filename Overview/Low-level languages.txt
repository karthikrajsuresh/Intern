Low-level languages

Low-level languages are programming languages that are closer to the hardware and have minimal abstraction from the computer's architecture. They are often used to write system software, device drivers, and other performance-critical applications where direct control over hardware resources is necessary.

There are two main types of low-level languages:

1. Machine Language: This is the lowest level of programming language. It consists of binary code that directly communicates with the computer's hardware. Each instruction corresponds to a specific operation the CPU can perform. Machine language is specific to the architecture of the CPU and is not portable between different types of processors.

2. Assembly Language: Assembly language is a more human-readable representation of machine language. Instead of binary code, assembly language uses mnemonic codes and symbols to represent machine instructions. Each mnemonic corresponds to a specific machine instruction. Assembly language programs must be translated into machine language using an assembler before they can be executed.

Low-level languages provide programmers with fine-grained control over hardware resources, allowing for highly efficient code execution. However, they are often more complex and less portable than high-level languages, requiring a deep understanding of computer architecture and hardware details.
