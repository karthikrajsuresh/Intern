1. Create: This operation involves adding new data to a database. For example, creating a new record in a table.

2. Read: This operation involves retrieving existing data from a database. For example, reading information from a table based on certain criteria.

3. Update: This operation involves modifying existing data in a database. For example, updating the information in a record to reflect changes.
