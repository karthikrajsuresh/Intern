Memory Management

In C#, memory management is primarily handled by the .NET runtime through a mechanism called the Garbage Collector (GC). Here's a brief overview of how memory management works in C#:

1. Managed Memory: In C#, memory allocation and deallocation are handled by the .NET runtime. When you create an object using the new keyword, memory is allocated from the managed heap.

2. Garbage Collection: The Garbage Collector periodically scans the managed heap to identify and reclaim memory that is no longer in use. It uses a mark-and-sweep algorithm to identify objects that are no longer referenced by any part of the program. When an object is no longer referenced, it becomes eligible for garbage collection.

3. Generations: The .NET Garbage Collector organizes objects on the managed heap into generations based on their lifetime. Newly allocated objects are placed in Generation 0. If an object survives a garbage collection, it is promoted to the next generation. This helps optimize the garbage collection process, as most objects are short-lived.

4. Finalization: C# allows you to define a finalizer for a class using the destructor syntax (~ClassName()). Finalizers are called by the GC before reclaiming memory occupied by an object. However, they are not guaranteed to execute promptly and should be used sparingly. Instead, it's better to implement the IDisposable interface for deterministic cleanup.

5. IDisposable and using Statement: The IDisposable interface provides a mechanism for releasing unmanaged resources such as file handles, database connections, etc. Classes that implement 'IDisposable' should release these resources in their 'Dispose()' method. The using statement ensures that 'Dispose()' is called even if an exception occurs.
